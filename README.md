## 🛠️ How it's Organized
Each folder in this repository is a standalone project. By using **Netlify's Base Directory** feature, I can host each folder as a separate live website.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- [x] Mastering Responsive Design with CSS
- [x] Understanding DOM Manipulation in JavaScript
- [ ] Transitioning projects to **React & Vite**
