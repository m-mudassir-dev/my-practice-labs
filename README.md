# 🚀 My Web Development Practice Labs

Welcome to my professional laboratory! This repository is a centralized collection of my frontend and full-stack projects. Each project is organized into its own directory for clean version control and independent deployment.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a standalone project:
* **/login page**: A responsive authentication interface.
* **/weather app**: A dynamic application fetching real-time weather data.
* **/hotjar-clone**: A high-fidelity frontend design of the Hotjar landing page.

## ⚙️ Deployment Info
All projects are hosted via **Netlify** using the "Base Directory" configuration to ensure each folder serves as an independent site.
